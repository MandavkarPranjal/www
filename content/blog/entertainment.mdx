If you want to read a story on any genre or topic, you can use ChatGPT to generate a short story, which has better quality than most short form videos on reels and YT shorts.
BTW, don't generate videos on those stories.

When I'm bored, I usually tell **GPT-5.2** to generate a short story to just read instead of watching a reels on insta.
GPT-5.2 is not that good at writing than **Kimi-K2-thinking** but it is better than anthropic models.
This trick might help you get into the reading books, but most people wouldn't like this way to get into reading.

When generating your story, toggle *deep research* or *thinking*

My goto prompt for this is:

> I want a story which starts as "a king whose son is prophesied to kill him so the king is like "whatever what am I supposed to do, kill my own kid wtf is wrong with me?""

> I want a story which starts as:
“The prophecy said my daughter would end my reign, and I laughed—because she was literally five years old and still afraid of frogs. But then the royal assassin bowed and asked, ‘Your Majesty… should I begin?’”
Make it darkly funny, emotional, and end with a twist.

> I want a story which starts as:
“I woke up on the day I die—again. The worst part wasn’t the dying. It was the fact that my future self left me a note saying: ‘Don’t trust your best friend. Also, don’t open the fridge.’”
Make it suspenseful with clever reveals and a satisfying ending.

> I want a story which starts as:
“The gods finally answered my prayers. Unfortunately, they sent an intern.”
Make it witty, chaotic, and slowly turn into something serious and epic.

> I want a story which starts as:
“Every night at 3:07 AM, my mirror shows someone standing behind me. Tonight, it blinked first.”
Make it creepy, slow-burn, and end with a chilling final line.

> I want a story which starts as:
“In Neon City, memories are currency. I was broke—until someone paid me with a memory of my own death.”
Make it gritty, fast-paced, and full of betrayals.

> I want a story which starts as:
“I fell in love with the one person I was hired to ruin. And the worst part? They were way better at ruining me.”
Make it intense, emotional, and not cheesy.

> I want a story which starts as:
“The world ended quietly. No explosions. Just… a notification that said: ‘Service discontinued.’”
Make it thoughtful, eerie, and hopeful by the end.

> I want a story which starts as:
“Stealing from the Dragon King was easy. Escaping with the thing I stole—my own name—was the hard part.”
Make it clever, adventurous, and include a strong crew dynamic.

> I want a story which starts as:
“I got my superpower at 18, just like everyone else. Mine was seeing how people die—whenever they looked at me.”
Make it tense, emotional, and character-driven.

> I want a story which starts as:
“Our town has one rule: never answer the door after sunset. Last night, I heard my own voice outside.”
Make it mysterious, escalating, and end with a big reveal.

But if you want to generate long story with better storytelling, twists, and emotions, then just improve your prompt like below or use chatGPT to improvize it.
