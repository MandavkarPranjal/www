- phone doesn't listen to you. What actually happening is way scarier than you think. If you're talking about something with someone and then you go use Instagram and you get an ad for it, you're freaking out because you think it heard the conversation. What they did was way worse. You saw the ad before, didn't realize, and it influenced the conversation. It's not that the phone know what you are talking about, it tells you what to talk about.
