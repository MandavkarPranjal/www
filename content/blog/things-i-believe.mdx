I believe in the following things:

- AI is not gonna replace us
- guy using AI will take jobs away from a normal guy
- its not hard, its just new
- opinions you think you have are never really your own, it's always conditioned unless it's a fact
- things are impossible if you don't try
- right direction * consistency = freedom
- you can just do it
- smart person is smarter cause he can learn faster

more on the way ...
