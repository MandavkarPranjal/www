> WMs === Window Managers
### Before knowing anything about WMs let me tell you how I used started using WMs

I've been used Windows for a long time, after I got laptop. I'm not a fan of Windows, but it is the first OS I used in my school life *(used MS Paint)* and was most familiar with.
But now I'm using Linux as my daily driver for past few months. At first, I was using GUI based WMs like Gnome, KDE, Xfce, etc. but I no where near as fast as [primeagen]. So I switched to [i3wm] without any configuration.
> How was the experience?? Awful.

Then I started to configure it. I added some key vim bindings to resize windows, move windows, etc. changed MOD key = Alt, like I'm used to while using [neovim]. After I configure i3 it felt native.

> Now my daily experience with i3 is awesome.

## So what is a Window Manager?

A **Window Manager (WM)** is a program that helps you control how windows look and behave on your computer screen. It lets you open, close, resize, and move windows, as well as organize how they overlap or stay visible. Some window managers work on their own, while others are part of a bigger desktop setup. They come in different styles, offering various levels of customization and performance to suit our needs.

My favorite window manager are [i3wm] & [hyprland].

## Why should you use a WM?

Using a Window Manager can greatly enhance your workflow and overall experience. It's often faster and more efficient than your default desktop environment, saving your time and effort.
Window Managers automatically arrange windows for you, eliminating the need to do it manually. They also offer a high degree of customization, allowing you to tailor your setup to fit your preferences ***(like how I did it)***.
Additionally, many default desktop environments aren't optimized for performance, while Window Managers are typically lightweight and focused on speed.

## Which WM should You use?

It's a matter of personal preference. Some people prefer the simplicity and speed of a WM, while others prefer the customization and control of a desktop environment. Using WMs is whole another experience.
I use [i3wm] because it's fast, lightweight, and customizable. But sometimes, I use [hyprland] for fun.

### For Linux Users

Their are many WMs for Linux, but some of the most popular ones are *[i3wm], [hyprland], [sway], [awesome], [openbox].*

### For Windows Users

Their are not so many WMs available. But there are some great looking WMs for Windows that I found while scrolling through YouTube & Internet [glazewm] & [workspacer].

### For Mac Users

I don't have a Mac, so I can't tell you which WM is best for Mac. But according to internet & reddit, I'd say [yabai] is the best.
